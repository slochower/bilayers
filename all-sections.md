## PPI-specific reviews
Balla [@cdNlk5wh] is a huge review that covers the background and physiology of PIs; section IX and X discuss the role of PIs in membranes. Subsection F therein approaches question "how do cells maintain their PM PtdIns(4,5)P₂ pools?" and goes into the suppression of phosphatases by Li<sup>+</sup> as well as the so-called "futile cycle" of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the 5-phosphate on PtdIns(4,5)P₂.

Table 1 has a list of PI-binding proteins, Table 2 covers interactions with ion channels, Tables 3/4 discuss endo- and exocytosis. Table 5 lists human diseases associated with inositol phosphatase defects.

## Protein binding
In [@UZnjanSP], D'Avanzo discusses the activation of Kir 2.1 channels specifically by PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> mediated by a cluster of positively charged residues; PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> has a small amount of activation. Yet high concentration of other PPIs can inhibit the effect of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> even though Kir 2.1 has tight affinity for PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(5)P. They used Autodock 4.2 to look at binding to PPIs, in the absence of a membrane, and were able to reacpitulate the crystal pose, finding a few clusters of bound lipids. 

> The number of poses in each subcluster is shown in Fig. 6B. The free energy of binding ($\Delta G_\text{binding}$) estimated from the docking simulations (Fig. 6C) is significantly higher for all monophosphorylated PIPs than for di- or triphosphorylated PIPs. This appears contrary to the observation of stronger binding of monophosphorylated, particularly PI(4)P and PI(5)P in the PIP Arrays. However, subclustering indicates that both PI(4)P and PI(5)P dock with a wider range of orientations than PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 6), suggesting that preferential binding to these monophosphorylated PIPs observed in the array may be entropically driven.
